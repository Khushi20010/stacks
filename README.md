Stacks

This repository contains C++ implementations of Stack data structures and their various applications. Stacks follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last inserted element is the first one to be removed.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Stack implementation using arrays

Stack implementation using linked lists

Programs to:

Reverse numbers/strings using stacks

Reverse a stack using recursion

Count the number of elements in a stack

Each program is written in C++ for clarity and efficiency.
